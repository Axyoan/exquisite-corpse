## Exquisite Corpse

[Exquisite corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse) is an "art game" where people add to a composition in sequence by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed. There are two types of posts, drawings and stories.

In drawings, first a user draws the top half of an image. Later another user continues this drawing but they are only allowed to see a small part of the bottom of the finished half. At that point the drawing is finished.

In stories, first a user starts writing a story. Later another user continues writing it but they are only allowed to see the last 100 characters from the previous contribution. This user can then decide whether the story is finished at that point, or pass it on to another user, repeating the process.

Finished posts appear in the gallery on the home page. Posts have a score and comment section for further interaction. Before posting or commenting users must be logged in and have a verified email.
